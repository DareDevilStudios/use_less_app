### Project Description
A unique productivity app designed to boost your motivation through a fresh approach: constructive demotivation. Share your daily to-dos, and the app responds with tailored, honest feedback that pushes you to accomplish more‚Äîevery day.

### The Problem (that doesn't exist)
Every to-do list app lacks the ability to motivate users to complete tasks day by day.

### The Solution (that nobody asked for)
Constructive criticism, but with a twist! Instead of typical encouragement, this app offers realistic, sometimes blunt feedback that keeps you on your toes, making you want to prove it wrong.
